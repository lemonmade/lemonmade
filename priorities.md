# Priorities

- Spend more time learning more about how business decisions get made, through on-the-frontlines experience and action-focused readings
- Find balance in the amount and variety of media consumed (movies, TV, sports, books, articles, music, podcasts)
- Find balance in the split between work projects, personal projects, and “open” personal time
- Practice writing more
- Stop procrastinating
  - Fewer, more well-maintained places to look
  - Fewer visual distractions at home
  - Respond to messages promptly, even if just to ask for more time
